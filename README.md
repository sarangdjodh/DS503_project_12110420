# DS503_project_12110420

This is a repository for the course project of DS503 (Advanced Data Analytics). The project is to build an end to end, multi-class, traffic sign classifier which is capable of identifying the type traffic sign when an image is fed to it. 

The multi class image classifier is made using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.

1. Problem:
Identifying the kind of traffic sign from given sign image.

2. Data:
The data we are using is collected by me from various sources available online, i.e. via Bing search and also common looking traffic signs of other countries are also added in this dataset, and the dataset now has only those signs that are India specific.

3. Evaluation:
> * The model will be tested on images which are actually clicked by me in the city of Nagpur. 

4. Features:
Some information about the data,
> * we are dealing with images (unstructured data) , so it's best we use deep learning or transfer learning.
> * there are 85 types of traffic signs (this means there are 85 different classes).
> * there are total 5193 labeled images in total.
